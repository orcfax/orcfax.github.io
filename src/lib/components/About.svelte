            <p>Orcfax is a decentralized blockchain oracle.</p>
            <p>Blockchains are blind to the real world.</p>
            <p>Oracles bridge the gap between off-chain and on-chain.</p>
            <p>
                But simply bringing off-chain data on-chain is not enough - it's only part of the
                solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the data is to be trustworthy, it needs to be verifiably accurate, authentic, and
                factual.

                Orcfax is not just an oracle - it's a truth machine for verifiable, auditable, and
                permanent statements of fact.
